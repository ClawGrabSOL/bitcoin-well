<h2>What are Bitcoins?</h2>
<p>
Bitcoins are a new kind of money. They aren't created or controlled by a government
(like dollars or euros), they're created and controlled by anybody who wants to
be part of the Bitcoin payment network. Visit the <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin.org</a>
website for all the geeky details.
</p>

<h2>How do I get a Bitcoin Receiving Address?</h2>
<p>
Download and install the Bitcoin program from <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">www.bitcoin.org</a>.
At the top of its main window it will show you Your Bitcoin Address.
</p>

<h2>I've got Bitcoins; how can I help?</h2>
<p>
Send them to the Bitcoin Well at
address 15VjRaDX9zpbA8LVnbrCAFzrVzN7ixHNsC and they'll be given away.
It may take up to 30 minutes for your donation to be added to the amount available.
</p>

<h2>What's the catch?</h2>
<p>
No catch-- I want Bitcoin to be successful, so I created this little service to give you a
few coins to start with.
